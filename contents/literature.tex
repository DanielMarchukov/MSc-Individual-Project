\subsection{Literature Survey}

 In \autocite{Lippi2016ArgumentationMS}, the authors focus on giving the reader a broad overview of argumentation and various computational challenges associated with it. Authors proceed to entertain the thoughts of what the breakthrough by solving these challenges would mean on a societal level and the impact of it. Moving on, the paper also describes different approaches that were previously experimented within the domains of argumentation and \gls{am}, mainly extracting arguments from unstructured text, which authors consider to be the core \gls{am} task. The core \gls{am} tasks are explained sufficiently for the reader to understand the differences between them. On the other hand, authors give only brief mentions to other \gls{am} tasks (opinionated claim analysis, premise verification, etc.), without giving a clear description of how they are different from each other. Also, the article does not provide any concrete evaluation of each methods, which makes it hard to gauge which approach has been the most successful so far or what the results were. Overall, the authors give a good overview of active research topics and different directions that the domain has taken.

 \gls{te} is one of the most popular approaches to identify argument \textit{attack} and \textit{support} relationships. The \autocite{Cabrio2012NaturalLA, Cabrio2012CombiningTE} papers give a general introduction to using \gls{te} as a means for identifying how one argument stands in relation to the other. Authors make a strong assumption that \textit{support} relation in \gls{baf} is the same as \textit{entailment} in \gls{te} and \textit{attack} in \gls{baf} is as \textit{contradiction} in \gls{te}. They test this theory on a set of arguments gathered from Debatepedia, an online debate forum where users express pros and cons on various topics. The language used at such discussions is quite different from loose and unstructured linguistics that can be seen in online social media corpus, which makes it hard to predict how the approach would do given a unpredictable environment. The system used for deciding if there exists a relation is called \gls{edits}, which states that the entailment relation probability of two arguments in a pair is greater the lower the number of changes need to be made between those two arguments, and vice versa. The chosen argument pair set is small, only 200 (100 used as a training set and 100 as test set), which is arguably insufficient to accurately assess the proposed approach, nevertheless, authors managed to accurately compute argument interrelations 75\% of the time, which is better than expected. In \autocite{Cabrio2013ANL, Cabrio2013DetectingBS}, the same authors have improved upon their research by exploring the \textit{support}-\textit{entailment} relationship, mostly by taking a step back on their previous assumption. The authors give an overview of semantic inferences in \gls{nlp}, in the sense that it is not always the case that an argument that supports another argument necessarily entails the latter argument in context. This was done by introducing a third labelling of argument pairs as \textit{null}, when such relation cannot be determined just from looking at those two arguments. Subsequently, same approach was applied to attacks, mainly by introducing 4 different types of complex attacks (\textit{supported}, \textit{mediated}, \textit{secondary}, \textit{extended}). The idea is similar, in that not all \textit{attacks} are \textit{contradictions}, thus making this case more subtle in general, requiring additional specification to identify attack relations. The results show that approximately 60\% of support argument pairs - \gls{te} holds; and for attacks - contradiction is present in about 70\% of argument pairs.
 
 Recently, the research in \gls{am} has taken a turn to social media, namely Twitter. Twitter is different from Debatepedia in that it often contains noisy, unstructured messages. This is mostly because of the specific restriction that Twitter imposes, being 140 character limit, which forces the user to express thoughts in short. Twitter is a good choice, because it provides open \gls{api} and it is possible to filter messages based on specific topics, that are defined with the use of a hashtag symbol (\#). In \autocite{Bosc2016DARTAD}, the authors describe their methodology for classifying tweets as argumentative or non-argumentative. The methodology provides extensive description of how to treat different types of tweets, how to evaluate the substance of each tweet and shows relevant examples. A further study \autocite{Bosc2016TweetiesSP} by the same authors put such dataset to practice. The paper divides the work into 4 major steps that have to be taken from start to finish and discusses different approaches within each of those steps. The steps are as follows: \textit{1)} tweets need to be separated into two pools - either argumentative or non-argumentative; \textit{2)} argumentative tweets need to be further divided into separate groups by topic, and then, argument pairs have to be created; \textit{3)} argument relationship within the argument pairs have to be predicted as either \textit{attack} or \textit{support}; \textit{4)} argumentation graph has to be built. First and second tasks are trivial compared to the third one, as is evident based on views expressed in the paper. Different approaches were tested while tackling the third task, \gls{eop}, \gls{te}, neural sequence classifiers, though all with unsatisfying results, accuracies being less than 20\%.

% It gives an overall picture about the work with a clear review of the relevant literature.  The background of the project should be given.  What have been done to deal with the problem should be stated clearly.  The pros and cons of various existing algorithms and approaches should be stated as well. Differences between your proposed method and the existing ones should be briefly described.
