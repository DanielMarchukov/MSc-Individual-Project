{\bf Abstract} \normalsize \vspace{5mm}

    Argumentation is a subject that incorporates computer science, language, logic and psychology among other fields, and tries to create a mathematical model of human reasoning and how humans argue in general. This project focuses on combining the extraction of reason from text of a given topic, identifying the relationship of one argument towards another, and analysing the resulting group of arguments towards a general consensus. The main goal is to combine these topics and create a single tool that can perform each of the actions sequentially and analyse Twitter messages pertaining to a specific topic. For this, a Long Short Term Memory neural network is trained, that uses the concepts of Textual Entailment to classify tuples of arguments. The result examines the social media stance on two major political parties of US and UK each, and analyses similarities and differences between them.
