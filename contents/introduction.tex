\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Project Aims, Objectives and Introduction} 
 \gls{am} is an intensive research field focused on automatically extracting arguments and their interrelationships from text documents. Due to recent technological advancements in other fields such as \gls{ai}, \gls{nlp} and \gls{ml}, this is becoming more and more possible. Moreover, internet provides unlimited amounts of data to analyse and extract arguments from with accessibility to websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Wikipedia Talks, Reddit and other popular social media pages \citep{Lippi2016ArgumentationMS}. 
 
 Unfortunately, this is not easy to do. The definition of argument is hard to express in mathematical or computer science terms. This is because the argument can range several sentences or paragraphs, can contain several arguments within itself, can support another argument or attack it, and is dependent on meaning, which becomes a natural language processing problem. Context of the argument is also important, because the identification of an argument in a social media site is different from an argument in a law or legal document \citep{Cocarascu2017MiningBA}.

 The ability to view and model such arguments provides important insight into how humans reason about different claims, how the claims are supported or disagreed with. This, of course, is a point of interest and connects many other disciplines such as logic, law, philosophy, psychology, social and computer sciences \citep{Lippi2016ArgumentationMS}. Also, this is a hot topic with regards to ethics within the \gls{ai} system. The decisions that we delegate to \gls{ai} to make, have to be verifiable, thus meaning the system has to be able to show the arguments that it worked with and how the consensus on the decision was made. On the other hand, same argument models can also allow us to investigate how a certain perception of something (review, feedback, etc.) can be altered \citep{ApproxToTruth}.
 
 The aim of this project is to create a tool that given a specific chain of arguments in text form would analyse such arguments and construct an \gls{af} displaying the winning or most convincing arguments.
 

\subsection{Background and Literature Survey} \label{sub:background}

This part is for literature review.

% It gives an overall picture about the work with a clear review of the relevant literature.  The background of the project should be given.  What have been done to deal with the problem should be stated clearly.  The pros and cons of various existing algorithms and approaches should be stated as well.  Differences between your proposed method and the existing ones should be briefly described.
