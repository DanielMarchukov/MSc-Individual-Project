\section{Technical Background} \label{techbackground}
    In this chapter, technical background is covered to equip the reader with the necessary knowledge for the next following sections. First of all, abstract and bipolar argumentation frameworks are presented in \cref{aaf} and \cref{baf} respectively. Afterwards, an introduction to Long Short Term Memories is given in \cref{lstm}, although in a much less technical language than the previous two subsections.

    \subsection{Abstract Argumentation Framework} \label{aaf}
        The \textit{argumentation framework} described here is based on \autocite{Dung1995OnTA}. Dung's \gls{af} considers the arguments to be abstract entities without paying any consideration to their internal structure. The way that argument's role is computed is by looking how it relates to other arguments within the argument set.
        
        \begin{definition}
            An \textit{Abstract Argumentation Framework} is a tuple $\langle S$, $R \rangle$, where $S$ is a set of \textit{arguments} and $R \subseteq S \times S$ is an \textit{attack relation}.
            \label{definition:definition1}
        \end{definition}
        
        \begin{remark}
            The terms \textit{argumentation framework} and \textit{abstract argumentation framework} will be used interchangeably throughout this document.
            \label{remark:remark1}
        \end{remark}
        
        The \gls{aaf} is represented as a directed graph. Arguments are displayed as nodes and an arrow from node $a$ to node $b$ represents that argument $a$ is attacking argument $b$.
        \begin{exa}
            Assume the following arguments:
            \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph* -]
                \item Today is sunny, we should go out to the park.
                \item I have to study at home for the upcoming exams.
                \item You still have over a month to prepare, so going out for one day won't hurt.
            \end{enumerate}
            \label{exa:example1}
        \end{exa}
        
        The above dialogue example can be represented as an \textit{abstract argumentation framework} $\langle S, \text{ }R \rangle$ where $S = \{a, b, c\}$ and $R = \{(a, b), (b, a), (c, b)\}$, as shown in \autoref{fig:aaf1example} below:
        \input{figures/aaf1example}
        \FloatBarrier
        
        \gls{af} uses semantics to analyse what sets of nodes (\textit{arguments}) can be reasonably accepted given their \textit{attack relation}. Specifically, for the scope of this work, extension-based semantics are explored. An extension is a set of arguments that are jointly acceptable under special circumstances/properties. An acceptable set of arguments is shown in \autoref{fig:aaf1examplecolorized}, following the \cref{exa:example1}.

        \FloatBarrier
        
        \subsubsection{Main Concepts}
            Before introducing different extensions, some concepts have to be defined first.
            \begin{definition}
                A set $T \subseteq S$ is \textit{conflict-free} if and only if $ \forall a, b \in T, (a, b) \notin R$
                \label{definition:definition2}
            \end{definition}
            
            What this does is takes all possible subsets of arguments and eliminates those subsets that contain conflicting arguments. The rule here does not concern with arguments having different context or topic, the only thing that matters is the fact that one argument does not attack another in that same subset. A more formal example is given below:
            
            \begin{exa}
                The \textbf{conflict-free} subsets of \autoref{fig:aaf1example} are: $\{\}, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{c\}, \{a, c\}$.
                \label{exa:example2}
            \end{exa}
            
            \begin{definition}
                A set $T \subseteq S$ \textit{defends} $b$ if and only if $ \forall a \in S$ such that $(a, b) \in R$ there exists $\exists c \in T$ such that $(c, a) \in R$.
                \label{definition:definition3}
            \end{definition}
            
            For example, if there is an attack relationship from one argument to another, then the defence concept would be illustrated by having another argument which in this case would attack the attacker. Or in other words, if someone is attacked on the street and a third party comes along (e.g. the police) then according to the definition above, the police \textit{defends} the victim. A more formal example is given below:
            
            \begin{exa}
                By looking at \autoref{fig:aaf1example}, the set $\{c\}$ \textbf{defends} $a$ and $\{\}$ \textbf{defends} $c$.
                \label{exa:example3}
            \end{exa}
            
            \begin{definition}
                A set $T \subseteq S$ is \textit{admissible} if and only if $T$ is \textit{conflict-free} and \textit{defends} each argument that is a member of $T$.
                \label{definition:definition4}
            \end{definition}
            
            \begin{exa}
                By looking at \autoref{fig:aaf1example}, the \textbf{admissible} sets are:  $\{\}, \{a\}, \{c\}, \{a, c\}$.
                \label{exa:example4}
            \end{exa}
            
            This is simply a combination of the previous two definitions. This can be easily computed by having two sets representing \textit{conflict-free} and \textit{defence} accordingly and finding the intersection between them.
            
            \begin{definition}
                $A$ is a \textit{maximal subset} of $S$ with respect to set inclusion in $C$ iff $\nexists A' \in C$ such that $A \subsetneq A'$.
                \label{definition:definition5}
            \end{definition}
            \begin{exa}
                Take $S = \{a, b, c\}$ and let $C = \{\{a\}, \{b\}, \{a, b\}, \{b, c\}\}$. The \textbf{maximal} subsets of $C$ in $S$ are $\{a, b\}$ and $\{b, c\}$.
                \label{exa:example5}
            \end{exa}
            
            In a more natural language terms, the maximal subset tries to take as many sets of arguments as possible such that the ones that are left (not included) are just smaller sets of (subsets) of the included ones.
            
            \begin{definition}
                $A$ is a \textit{minimal subset} of $S$ with respect to set inclusion in $C$ iff $\nexists A' \in C$ such that $A' \subsetneq A$.
                \label{definition:definition6}
            \end{definition}
            \begin{exa}
                Take $S = \{a, b, c\}$ and let $C = \{\{a\}, \{b\}, \{a, b\}, \{b, c\}\}$. The \textbf{minimal} subsets of $C$ in $S$ are $\{a\}$ and $\{b\}$.
                \label{exa:example6}
            \end{exa}
            
            The opposite goes for minimal subsets. Here the goal is to include the smallest sets of arguments (e.g. empty set or set with only a single argument in it) and exclude those sets of arguments that are supersets. 
            
            One thing to note is that in both cases, maximal and minimal sets, the goal is to include as many sets of arguments as possible, as long as the specified rules are met. Even though in both examples the result is that bigger set of arguments are in maximal set and smaller set of arguments is in minimal set, the size of the sets do not play a factor here. It could very well be a case where the same set containing of a number of arguments is in minimal and maximal subsets, as long as it does not break the defined rule.
        
        \subsubsection{Semantic Extensions}
            Now moving on to semantic extensions:
            \begin{definition}
                A \textit{complete extension} is an admissible set that includes \textit{all} arguments it defends.
                \label{definition:definition7}
            \end{definition}
            
            Complete extension adds one more rule to admissible sets. Admissible set is said to contain arguments that do not attack each other (contradict) and include arguments that are defended by that set. Complete extension makes it so that \textit{all} defended arguments need to be included for the set to be considered complete.
            
            \begin{definition}
                A \textit{grounded extension} is the minimal subset of the set of \textit{complete extensions}.
                \label{definition:definition8}
            \end{definition}
            \begin{exa}
                From \autoref{fig:aaf2example} can be seen that \textbf{complete extensions} are: $\{a\}, \{a, c\}, \{a. d\}$. \textbf{Grounded extensions} are: $\{a\}$.
                \label{exa:example8}
            \end{exa}
            
            Grounded extension contains a set of arguments that are \textit{safe} to accept as the general consensus or winning arguments. They represent the base minimum outcome that can be claimed based on arguments presented.
            
            \input{figures/aaf2example}
            \begin{definition}
                A \textit{preferred extension} is the maximal subset of the set of \textit{complete extensions}.
                \label{definition:definition9}
            \end{definition}
            \begin{exa}
                From \autoref{fig:aaf2example} can be seen that \textbf{complete extensions} are: $\{a\}, \{a, c\}, \{a. d\}$. \textbf{Preferred extensions} are: $\{a, c\}, \{a. d\}$.
                \label{exa:example9}
            \end{exa}
            
            The main difference in grounded and preferred extensions is the strictness on which arguments to include. The grounded extension provides a minimum amount of arguments that can be deducted as the overall result, while the preferred extensions tries to include as much as possible, thus including arguments in the results that might be a bit loose in terms of argumentative grounding.
        
    \subsection{Bipolar Argumentation Framework} \label{baf}
        The limitation with \gls{aaf}s is that only conflicting relations are captured. The framework has difficulties capturing \textit{support} arguments, that is, when one argument is in agreement of the other. \gls{baf} aims at extending upon the concepts presented by Dung's framework \autocite{Dung1995OnTA}. In \autocite{Cayrol2005OnTA}, the author introduces another dimension through which argument relations can be captured and incorporates it into \gls{aaf}. 
        
        In terms of the framework (graph) itself, nodes still represent the \textit{arguments}, and solid arrows represent \textit{attacks}. \textit{Support} relation is also represented as an arrow, indicating that argument $a$ supports argument $b$. There are no strict requirements for how the arrows have to be drawn within the framework, so in this project a dotted arrow will be used to indicate \textit{support} (see \autoref{fig:baf1example}).
        
        \begin{definition}
            An \textit{Abstract Bipolar Argumentation Framework} is a tuple $\langle S, \text{ }R_{att}, \text{ }R_{sup} \rangle$, where $S$ is a set of \textit{arguments},  $R_{att}$ is a binary \textit{attack relation} and $R_{sup}$ is a binary \textit{support relation}.
            \label{definition:definition10}
        \end{definition}
        \begin{exa}
            Take $T_{i}$, $T_{j} \in S$. $T_{i}R_{att}T_{j}$ (contrastively, $T_{i}R_{sup}T_{j}$) indicates that $T_{i}$ \textbf{attacks} $T_{j}$ (respectively, $T_{i}$ \textbf{supports} $T_{j}$).
            \label{exa:example10}
        \end{exa}
        
        \input{figures/baf1example}
        
        \subsubsection{Main Concepts}
            The main concepts and definitions of \gls{baf} are presented briefly, based on \autocite{Cayrol2005OnTA}. The main benefit of \gls{baf} is that another dimension is included, thus providing a way to model complex argumentative structures in a more representative manner. Previously, the aspect of \textit{support} in \gls{aaf} is always indirect, depicted mostly by argument \textit{defence}. This is an inaccurate assumption in \gls{aaf}, because two arguments being against something does not mean or imply that those two arguments are coming from the same standpoint. \gls{aaf} treats unrelated arguments as being on the same page or arguing for the same thing, as long as they both are targeting the same argument. \gls{baf} tries to solve this problem by separating \textit{attack} and \textit{support} relations.
            
            Firstly, two definitions of attacks are introduced, being \textit{supported} and \textit{indirect}:
            
            \begin{definition}
                Take $A$, $B \subseteq S$. A \textit{supported attack} is a sequence of arguments and relations $A_{1} R_{1} \ldots R_{n - 1} A_{n}$, $n \geq 3$ with $A_{n}$ $=$ $B$, $\forall i$ = $1 \ldots n$ $-$ $2$, $R_{i}$ $=$ $R_{sup}$ and $R_{n - 1}$ $=$ $R_{att}$.
                \label{definition:definition11}
            \end{definition}
            
            \begin{definition}
                Take $A$, $B \subseteq S$. An \textit{indirect attack} is a sequence of arguments and relations $A_{1} R_{1} \ldots R_{n - 1} A_{n}$, $n \geq 3$ with $A_{n}$ $=$ $B$, $\forall i$ = $2 \ldots n$ $-$ $1$, $R_{i}$ $=$ $R_{sup}$ and $R_{1}$ $=$ $R_{att}$.
                \label{definition:definition12}
            \end{definition}
            
            \begin{exa}
                From \autoref{fig:baf1example} it can be seen that sequences $a \rightarrow d \rightarrow g \rightarrow h$ and $e \rightarrow g$ are \textbf{supported attacks}. Subsequently, the sequence $b \rightarrow a \rightarrow d \rightarrow g$ is an \textbf{indirect attack}.
                \label{exa:example11}
            \end{exa}
            
            The supported attack concept can be visualised as follows: if two people are having an argument, and a third person sides with one of them, then the third person must be against the other one.
            
            For the indirect attacks, this means that, for example, if a person has an argument against one of political figure's supporters, then that same person must be against that political figure as well.
            
            Next, the \textit{argument-set} versus the \textit{argument} relations are also defined, namely \textit{set-attacks}, \textit{set-supports} and \textit{set-defends}.
            
            \begin{definition}
                Take $T \subseteq S$ and $B \in S$. A \textit{set-attack} from $T$ to $B$ is if and only if there exists a \textit{supported attack} or an \textit{indirect attack} against $B$ from an argument in set $T$.
                \label{definition:definition13}
            \end{definition}
            
            \begin{definition}
                Take $T \subseteq S$ and $B \in S$. A \textit{set-support} relation from set $T$ to argument $B$ is if and only if in the sequence $T_{1} R_{1} \ldots R_{n - 1} T_{n}$, $n \geq 2$, $\forall i$ = $1 \ldots n$ $-$ $1$, $R_{i}$ $=$ $R_{sup}$, $T_{n}$ $=$ $B$, $T_{n - 1} \in S$.
                \label{definition:definition14}
            \end{definition}
            
            In other words, if within a set of arguments there is an argument that is attacking another argument outside of that set, then that can be regarded as a \textit{set-attack}. On the contrary, if in the argument set there exists a chain of support that contains all arguments from the set and extends into an argument outside of the set, then this is to be a \textit{set-support}. A more formal example is given below.
            
            \begin{exa}
                From \autoref{fig:baf1example} it can be seen that a set with arguments $\{a, c\}$ \textbf{set-attacks} $h$ and $d$. Also, $\{a, c\}$ \textbf{set-supports} $d$.
                \label{exa:example12}
            \end{exa}
            
            \begin{definition}
                Take $T \subseteq S$ and $A \in S$. A set $T$ \textit{set-defends} $A$ if and only if $\forall B \in S$, if $\{B\}$ \textit{set-attacks} $A$ $\implies$ $\exists C \in S$, $\{C\}$ \textit{set-attacks} $B$.
                \label{definition:definition15}
            \end{definition}
            
            The idea here is the same as the \textit{defence} in \gls{aaf} concepts, except here it is being dealt with a set of arguments instead of individual arguments.
            
            \begin{exa}
                From \autoref{fig:baf1example} it can be seen that a set with arguments $\{b, c, f\}$ and $\{b, c, e\}$ \textbf{set-defends} $h$. Also, $\{b, f\}$ does not \textbf{set-defend} $h$.
                \label{exa:example13}
            \end{exa}
            
            Before moving on to admissibility of sets, conflict-free sets are introduced.
            
            \begin{definition}
                Take $T \subseteq S$. A \textit{conflict-free} set is a set of arguments $T$ if and only if $\nexists A$, $B \in T$, $\{A\} \text{ set-attacks } B$.
                \label{definition:definition16}
            \end{definition}
            
            The goal here is to have such set of arguments that do not contradict (attack) each other. This time the concern goes not only for individual relationships between arguments, but any combination of subsets of arguments as well.
            
            \begin{exa}
                From \autoref{fig:baf1example} it can be seen that the sets with arguments $\{c, d\}$ and $\{c, g\}$ are not \textbf{conflict-free}. On the other hand, $\{a, c\}$ and $\{d, i\}$ are \textbf{conflict-free}.
                \label{exa:example14}
            \end{exa}
            
        \subsubsection{Semantic Extensions}
            The author of \autocite{Cayrol2005OnTA} proposed new semantic extensions that build up from the concepts in \autocite{Dung1995OnTA} and expand upon the acceptability of arguments within the \gls{baf}. Same as in previous section, they are briefly presented here.
            
            \begin{definition}
                Take $T \subseteq S$. A \textit{d-admissible} set is a set of arguments $T$ if and only if $T$ is \textit{conflict-free} and \textit{set-defends} all arguments in $T$.
                \label{definition:definition20}
            \end{definition}
            
            An equivalent in \gls{aaf} would be the complete extension, ensuring that only non-contradicting arguments are included and additionally those that are defended.
            
            \begin{definition}
                Take $T \subseteq S$. A \textit{d-grounded extension} is a set of arguments $T$ if and only if $T$ is minimal with respect to \textit{d-admissible} subsets of $S$. 
                \label{definition:definition23}
            \end{definition}
            
            \begin{definition}
                Take $T \subseteq S$. A \textit{d-preferred extension} is a set of arguments $T$ if and only if $T$ is maximal with respect to \textit{d-admissible} subsets of $S$. 
                \label{definition:definition24}
            \end{definition}
            
            The two definitions above correspond to grounded and preferred extensions in \gls{aaf} respectively.
            
            In conclusion, the concepts, definitions and examples provided in the technical background section should sufficiently cover the theoretical knowledge required to understand the project. The next section dives into implementation details of the topic.
    
    \subsection{Long Short-Term Memory} \label{lstm}
        This subsection is presented in a non-technical language because the different specifics of \gls{lstm} are not delved into during the project's design and implementation decisions. The core underlying processes of \gls{lstm} that are presented here are dealt with by the help of a library called TensorFlow (also presented in later chapters). Because of that, only a brief high level overview is given to equip the reader the necessary knowledge to know what \gls{lstm}s are, excluding complicated mathematical functions that go into calculating different values.
        
        \gls{lstm} is a unique neural network in a sense that it is specifically made to support learning long-term dependencies, originally created by \autocite{Hochreiter1997LongSM}. \gls{lstm} is composed of four main layers, called cell, input gate, forget gate and output gate. Each of those components are explained below.
        
        \subsubsection{Cell State}
            The cell state is the information that is currently held in memory by the \gls{lstm}. The way that \gls{lstm} works is very similar to what is known about how human brains process memories and remember things. So in this case, the cell state is the memory itself. Naturally, some memories last shorter than others and are forgotten, so the cell state is holding the information for an arbitrary amount of time that the neural network decides to be fit.
            
            The cell state is constantly being updated and filtered as it gets passed through gates and various functions and layers are applied to stored values.
            
        \subsubsection{Forget Gate}
            The first step that happens during \gls{lstm} processing is data is put through a forget gate. Since the all of the information in the cell state is numbers and fractions, forget gate outputs values between zero to one, assigning preferences to one cell state values over others. The decision and calculation of values between zero and one is done by the sigmoid layer, where a zero indicates that something should be \textit{forgotten}, while one - \textit{remembered}.
            
            To continue the example of comparing similarities to how human brain works, when a person reads a piece of text, it does not remember everything letter to letter, word to word. Usually, what that person remembers is only the main key words that convey the message of the text, while the not important parts are forgotten. The forget gate is tasked with deciding which parts are not important enough for it to be sensible enough to forget them.
            
        \subsubsection{Input Gate}
            The job of the input gate is to let new information through. This is the opposite effect of the forget gate. Existing values are updated based on new input if their importance increases (or decreases) and, subsequently, new candidate values are calculated, that would fill the empty spots left by the forget gate.
            
            What happens next is the processed values of input and forget gates are combined into the cell state. The current cell state is multiplied by the forget gate values that discard the information that is deemed to be unnecessary, while the input gate adds new values and scales them to be in line with previous calculations.
            
            Again, going back to previous example, the equivalent of an input gate is a person reading a second paragraph after having read the first one. The process of taking in new things and forgetting previous information is happening almost simultaneously, as new information comes in, current information is updated with new context, additional value is given to previous details while at the same time things that turn out to be not important are forgotten.
            
        \subsubsection{Output Gate}
            The output gate is the last step in the process. What happens here is a decision is made on which values are actually going to be remembered. Note that previously mentioned gates are only tasked with forgetting and adding new information to the cell state.
            
            First of all, a sigmoid layer is run on the cell state which decides what values are going to be output. Secondly, the cell is put through a tanh function that pushes the values between -1 and 1. Thirdly, outputs of the sigmoid layer and tanh function are multiplied with each other, so that the overall output is only those parts that were decided.
            
            To finish off with an example, after a person reads two paragraphs, the memory of those two paragraphs (or what is left of it) is the result of the output gate in this case (being the finalised information inside the cell state).
