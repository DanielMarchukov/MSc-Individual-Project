\section{Conclusion} \label{conclusions}
    This section briefly summarises what has been achieved throughout the project. Analysis performed on two government systems used by English speaking countries showcase interesting social tendencies how the public treats and reacts to opposing parties. It is sufficient to say that this is only the tip of the iceberg and there are many different topics that can be explored in the same manner, not only politics as was chosen here.
    
    The contribution to research community is substantial. The trained classifier is in line with expected performance given the circumstances of hardware limitations, and the overall software is a stepping stone to combining argument mining, extraction, relation detection and framework analysis into one coherent process, with high hopes of becoming an advanced system capable of handling multiple models and multiple social media platforms.
