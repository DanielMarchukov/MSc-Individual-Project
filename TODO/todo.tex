For Introduction:
\begin{itemize}
    \item There is a bit too much technical detail for the introduction. You should aim your introduction to a computer scientist that doesn't know about argumentation. So spend some time to explain the general idea of argumentation before getting into argument mining.

    \item The information is quite dense. Spend some more time to explain the concepts you are stating. For example, in paragraph 2, in the list of difficulties you could explain each of these in their own sentence.

    \item What is an argument attack? What is the context of an argument? What makes social media different to legal documents? Make sure your reader understand what you mean by these points.

    \item The motivation in the third paragraph is good. I would move this above the explanation of why the problem is challenging. 

    \item You might want to put each of these in their own subsection.
\end{itemize}
