    Short description of each goal:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Research Code Libraries - analysing existing code libraries and frameworks, making a choice on programming language, etc.
        \item Web Scraper - decide on a mechanism of extracting text/arguments from social media, whether that's a manually coded web scraper or access to \gls{api} if there is one.
        \item Social Media Data Mining - transforming raw text into data structures for future \gls{te} algorithm use.
        \item Implementation of \gls{te} Algorithms - implementing the \gls{te} algorithm with specific properties/parameters that suit the project.
        \item Evaluation of \gls{te} Algorithms - testing and evaluating the results of the algorithms implemented.
        \item Implementation of \gls{af} - using the results of \gls{te} algorithm to build \gls{af}.
        \item Overall System Testing - putting everything together into a coherent project and performing overall evaluation.
        \item Conclusion, Presentation, Future Work - drawing appropriate conclusions of the project, proposing future work areas or possible improvements, creating presentation slides, other finishing works.
    \end{itemize}
